$r_{ik} \in \{0,1 \}$ This will make any data point $x_{i}$ belong to ($r_{ik} = 1$) or not belong to ($r_{ik} = 0$) centroid $\mu_{k}$ 

\[
r_{ik}= 
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } ||x_{i} - \mu_{k}||^2 < ||x_{i} - \mu_{l}||^2, \forall l \neq k\\
0, & \text{otherwise}

$r_{ik} \in [0,1]$ This will make $i^{th}$ line of matrix $R$ the probability vector of data point $x_{i}$ considering a Softmax Function.

$$
r_{ik} = \frac{e^{- \beta ||x_{i} - \mu_{k}||^{2}}}{\sum\limits_{l=1}^{k}e^{- \beta ||x_{i} - \mu_{l}||^{2}}}
$$
where the parameter $\beta > 0$ is called stiffness parameter.

No. Assume the first two initial centers we initialize both on the outer circle but one is on the right, the other is on the left. After running K-Means algorithm, we will get two cluster which contains both inner and outer semi-circle respectively. It is not what we expected.
